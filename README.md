# Deep Learning approach for Diabetic retinopathy

Automatic diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening is a well identified area of research in the domain of computer vision. It is challenging due to structural complexity and marginal contrast difference between fundus image and the background. In this report, we have discussed the deep learning frame-work for the grading of retinal images as well as segmentation of the optic disc and blood vessels as experimented in our project. This frame-work detects the lesions such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates present in fundus images and grades them accordingly (DR-grading). We have tested this frame-work with a publicly available retinal images dataset i.e. APTOS. The accuracy on APTOS dataset is better performing than the trivial methods. Improvement in DR grading is expected due to the deep learning approach used.
